# Moments

This project is a social media app created using JavaScript where one can upload a "moment" that includes their name, a title, picture, description and tags. 
Each "moment" had a like function, a delete function, and also an edit function. This was a MERN project, created using MongoDB, Express, React and Node.
React was used for the frontend, Express and Node for the backend, and MongoDB was used for the database.
